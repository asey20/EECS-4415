
The program that was created in part A only calculates the number of occurences of each uni/bi/trigram. If we would like to find out the frequency instead then we would need to calculate these occurences based on a unit of time. Rather then using a unit of time based on seconds (e.g mins, hours, etc) I would opt for using a counter to count the number of uni/bi/trigrams that have passed since the last occurence of that particular gram (e.g. 108 grams pass until "I love icecream" occurs again). Then this counter would be reset and the process would repeat for each gram until all the counter values were calculated for each gram. Finally, the frequency would be calculated for each gram by taking the total count value for each gram and dividing it by the number of occurences of the gram. For example, "big apple" occured 3 times with the counter values: 70, 30 and 200. After totaling these counter values we will be left with a total count of 300 grams. To calculate the frequency we then do 300 total counts / 3 occurences to get a frequency of 100 grams per 1 occurence of that gram. The MapReduce would be responsible for dealing with all the different counters for each gram via Hadoop (pretty fast vs native python).
